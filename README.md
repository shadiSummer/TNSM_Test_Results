Additional test results regarding the "Improving QoE with Genetic Algorithm-based Path Selection for MPTCP" article

The tests were performed with 5, 10, 20, and 30 sets of clients. The bandwidth of the links in the topologies increases linearly as the number of clients rises. In the experiments, two sets of bandwidth values are used over the three topologies to show the performance evaluation under different conditions. The first setting is called the normal bandwidth setting and the bandwidth values of the paths are enough to send the video with a moderate bitrate to each client. The bandwidth values of the links are distributed with Poisson. The second setting is called the limited bandwidth setting. In this setting, the bandwidth values of the links were limited to create a congested network. Although we set the fixed bandwidth values for the paths in these settings, the available bandwidth values do not remain stable due to the competing MPTCP connections. In both bandwidth settings, the delay value of the paths varies between 50 ms to 100 ms.
